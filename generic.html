								<h3>Devadath G Nair</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/profilepic.jpeg" alt="" /></span>A results-driven Data Science Enthusiast and a Business Analyst with 1+ year experience in client-focused operations, innovative solutioning, and efficient customer interaction. Expert in eliciting, analyzing, and documenting business requirements, known for strong analytical, communication, and problem-solving skills.</p>
								<p>My journey into the world of data science began with a deep-rooted fascination for uncovering insights from data and using them to drive real-world solutions. I had worked as a Junior Business Analyst for a service based company in the IT sector. The decision to become a Business Analyst was grounded in the belief that technical skills, while vital, are most impactful when combined with a profound understanding of the business context. This conviction led me to choose a career as a Business Analyst at 2Base Technologies. As one of the primary business analyst for the project, I managed more than 2 million users, a role typically entrusted to experienced professionals. This experience fortified my belief that technical skills, while crucial, are most impactful when combined with a deep understanding of the business context.</p>
								<p>In pursuit of my aspiration to become a data scientist, I made the bold decision to resign from my role as a Business Analyst. This risk reflects my dedication to expanding my skill set independently, an endeavor that has fueled my determination to succeed in the field of data science.</p>
								<p>Currently I am pursuing Master's Program In Data Science and Advanced Programming from IIT Madras DSA Zen Data Science, GUVI.</p>
